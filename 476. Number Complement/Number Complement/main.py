# Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary
# representation.
#
# Note: 1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer. 2. You could assume no
# leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation. Example 1: Input: 5 Output: 2 Explanation: The binary
# representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2. Example 2:
# Input: 1 Output: 0 Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is
# 0. So you need to output 0.
